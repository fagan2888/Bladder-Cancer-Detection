    "# A Data Science Framework: \n",
    "\n",
    "Architecture for the bladder cancer analytics and prediction via machine-learning\n",
    "\n",
    "#Define the Problem: Traditional way to diagnosis or prognosis cancer relys on biopsy, cancer is discovered usually after it reached a certain size or entern the mid/late stage. At the same time, biopsy also relys on the pathologist's experience. Different pathologist might have different opinion against the cancer samples. Developing a non-invasive, and object measurement of patients' sample and making un-bised judgement on the biopsy is the goal in the cancer clinical communities. This study measured over 2500 miRNA genes from the peripheral blood samples of bladder cancer patients of different stages, plus samples from normal persons as well as samples from other cancers as control.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope this study can identify biomarker signatures in the bladder cancer that might be used for diagnosis/prognosis/cancer staging. Through machine learning and predictive analytics, we aim to develop a method that can be used to predict bladder cancer in the early stage.\n",
    "●Hypothesis or project topic\n",
    "➢Cancer is a disease of molecular dis-regulations, Is there a unique molecular signature for bladder cancer samples? \n",
    "➢If there is a signature, can we build a data product that can identify bladder cancer for a given blood sample?\n",
    "➢Can non-invasive, early detection of bladder cancer achievable?, with high accuracy and high sensitivity?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#Gather the Data: \n",
    "➢Dataset is downloaded from GEO/NCBI/NIH; \n",
    "➢This data set contains profiles of 972 samples, which consist of 392 bladder cancer, 100 non-cancer control, and 480 other types of cancer patients. Each sample has about 2600 variables to describe it.\n",
    "➢Bladder cancer, non-cancer control, other cancers are the class labels.\n",
    "➢miRNA measurement and gender/age/locations are the major features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#Prepare Data for Consumption: \n",
    "\n",
    "This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Perform Exploratory Analysis: Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Model Data: Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It's important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Validate and Implement Data Model: After you've trained your model based on a subset of your data, it's time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven't overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Optimize and Strategize: This is the \"bionic man\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you're able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\" rate.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "# Workflow goals\n",
    "\n",
    "#The data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\n",
    "#Classifying. We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\n",
    "#Correlating. One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a correlation among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\n",
    "#Converting. For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\n",
    "#Completing. Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\n",
    "#Correcting. We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\n",
    "#Creating. Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\n",
    "#Charting. How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals."

    "Using Scikit-learn\n",
    "Scikit-Learn is a powerful machine learning library implemented in Python with numeric and scientific computing powerhouses Numpy, Scipy, and matplotlib for extremely fast analysis of small to medium-sized data sets. It is open source, commercially usable and contains many modern machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, feature extraction, and optimization. For this reason Scikit-Learn is often the first tool in a data scientist's toolkit for machine learning of incoming data sets.\n",
    "Scikit-learn will expect numeric values and no blanks, so first we need to do a bit more wrangling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation\n",
    "For Kaggle, the training samples are constructed by splitting our original dataset into more than one part. But what if certain chunks of our data have more variance than others? We want to ensure that our model performs just as well regardless of the particular way the data are divided up. So let's go back and do some cross-validation splits. \n",
    "More on cross-validation tools inside Scikit-learn here:\n",
